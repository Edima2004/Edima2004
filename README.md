- 👋 Hi, I’m Vincent-Thompson Edima,
- 👥 I was part of a team of frontend Developers resposible for building the frontend of a large scale e-commerce WebApp for the sale, rent, and lease of landed properties in Nigeria. My task alongside working on my assigned pages was to build a Context Api to house most of the functionality as well as fix bugs in the Frontend and get rid of DRY codes.
- 🌱 I have built multiple projects with React JS in combination with Node Js (MERN Stack)
- ✨ I have also built projects with Next js with prisma as my database.
- 🔥 My React e-commerce WebApp makes use of context-Api to handle most of the functionality alongside the implementation of stripe payment infrastructure to handle the checkout page (live site- marvel-kitchen.netlify.app ).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting and exciting projects and offer my full support to the team
- 📫 How to reach me? You can send an email to edimavthompson@gmail.com ... I would greatly appreciate any interesting project to work together on and I'm open to complex ones too.
